# Emoji

Welcome to your Giftmojis v3. This app will enable you to purchase giftmojis and gift them to your friends. If you have been granted special admin privileges, you can also create giftmojis that you can later buy, or you can just create them for the store. Enjoy!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'emoji'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install emoji

## Usage

You can use it by going to the website, and sign up there.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
